# Numeracy resources for everyone

There is so much avaliable out there for supporting numeracy at this level but it is often challenging to find, organise and work through these resources. 

Along with future tools and resources that will be developed under this project one of the core aspects that needs to be addressed is what, where and how do we use the resources that are already avaliable to students and the community more generally.

# Project mission

To create a collection of leading edge tools for learning numeracy for students. There are many online tools that are cost based. This is ment to be supported by local community and shows the ability to generate custom written applications for secondary education.

## Project goal

To build a resource hub for working through numeracy learning and application. Extending into the concept of multi-media content in this space. For example having both interactive applications and paper versions of the same content with the concept of being able to generate different random or selected aspects of the assessment.

## Tools being developed

Information database about the numeracy standard needed for NCEA level 1

### Detailed Development Tasks ðŸš€


Here's a task list for the website development, organized for clarity and ready for a GitHub README file.
This list outlines the jobs needed to integrate all missing information into the website. The goal is to create a comprehensive and easy-to-use resource for students preparing for the NCEA Numeracy Co-requisite.

---

#### Phase 1: Foundational Content & Structure

**Objective:** Build the core sections of the website with essential information.

- Define the aspects of the website that will be accessable to everyone
- Is there going to be a firewall with some content?

* **Task 1: Create 'Numeracy Co-requisite Overview' Section**

The explicit statement that the literacy and numeracy co-requisite standards were created by the Ministry of Education and became a mandatory part of NCEA in 2024.
The overarching purpose of these changes: to ensure high school students graduate with strong foundations in literacy and numeracy.

Confirmation that students must pass one Numeracy assessment (US32406), along with two literacy assessments, to gain any NCEA qualification (Level 1, 2, or 3) from 2024 onwards.

    * State that the literacy and numeracy co-requisite became mandatory in **2024** by the Ministry of Education.
    * Explain its purpose: to ensure students have strong literacy and numeracy foundations.
    * Confirm that passing **US32406** is required for any NCEA qualification (Level 1, 2, or 3).
    * Include the **38% failure rate statistic** from 2023 to emphasize the assessment's importance.
    * Mention that the Numeracy CAA is worth **10 credits**.

* **Task 2: Develop 'Understanding Numeracy Standards' Section**
    * Define **numeracy** as per NZQA Unit Standard 26623.
    * Explain the distinction between numeracy and mathematics standards.
    * List the other two numeracy standards: **26627** (Use measurement) and **26626** (Interpret statistical information).
    * Summarize the purpose and content of **US26623**.
    * Detail the assessment requirements for US26623, including the use of **naturally occurring evidence** and the definitions of a **"problem"** and **"effective strategies"**.
    * Specify the performance criteria for US26623, detailing the number of times operations and number types must be demonstrated.

#### Phase 2: Assessment & Skills Breakdown

**Objective:** Provide detailed information about the assessment itself and the skills required.

* **Task 3: Build 'Numeracy CAA Skills Breakdown' Section**
    * Create a comprehensive list of all skills required for **Unit Standard 32406**, including:
        * Number operations
        * Mathematical relationships
        * Spatial properties
        * Location and navigation
        * Measurement
        * Statistics and data
        * Probability

* **Task 4: Design 'Assessment Information' Page**
    * Describe the CAA as an externally assessed, online activity.
    * Clearly state the only grades are **Achieved** and **Not Achieved**.
    * Inform students about **unlimited resit opportunities**.
    * Explain how to access feedback via the **NZQA Login page**.
    * Advise students to check the official **NZQA list for approved calculators**.

---

#### Phase 3: Practice & Support

**Objective:** Offer practical tools, strategies, and resources for student success.

* **Task 5: Integrate 'Self-Evaluation & Practice Checklist'**
    * Create an interactive or downloadable checklist covering all CAA topics: Number, Shape, Location, Measurement, Statistics, and Probability.
    * Include example questions with model solutions for each topic.
    * Incorporate a self-assessment feature (e.g., a simple checkbox system).
    * **Crucially**, remind students that calculators are permitted.

* **Task 6: Add 'Study Strategies & Success Tips' Section**
    * Implement the **4-phase study strategy**: Understand, Practice, Reinforce, and Support.
    * Include practical advice from students and teachers (e.g., "show your working," "ask for help").
    * Highlight the key insight that the CAA is **"as much a reading test as a math one"**.

* **Task 7: Curate an 'Additional Resources' Page**
    * List external resources like **Pathways Awarua** and relevant workbooks.
    * Suggest **"Infinity Plus One"** on YouTube for visual explanations.

#### Phase 4: Website Administration

**Objective:** Finalize the website with administrative and contact details.

* **Task 8: Add 'About Us' and 'Contact Information'**
    * Provide contact details (phone, email, address) for the organization behind the website (e.g., Northcote College or Boost Your Learning).
    * Consider adding testimonials if available.

* **Task 9: Add Credits and Cost Information (if applicable)**
    * If the website offers courses, detail the modules and their pricing.
    * Specify which modules are free (e.g., Number) and the cost of others (e.g., NZ$25.00).
