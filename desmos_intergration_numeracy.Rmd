The added value of using Desmos for learning numeracy is both vital and insightful because it transforms abstract numerical concepts into dynamic, interactive visualisations. Unlike static pen-and-paper exercises, Desmos allows learners to actively manipulate variables and parameters, instantly seeing the graphical consequences. For instance, a student can use a slider to change the slope of a line and intuitively grasp how this value affects its steepness, or explore how changing coefficients in a polynomial function alters its roots and shape. This immediate, visual feedback is profoundly insightful, bridging the gap between symbolic algebraic representation and tangible geometric understanding.

```

#### A cool interactive graph

This interactive exploration makes learning an active process of discovery rather than a passive one of reception, which is a vital shift for developing deep conceptual fluency and confidence in mathematics.
